# OptiFund: AI-Powered ESG Portfolio Optimization (AI4ALL IGNITE Project, Summer 2025)

OptiFund is a reinforcement learning-based portfolio optimization system that combines traditional financial metrics with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) considerations to create sustainable, high-performing investment portfolios.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Portfolio Optimization**: Uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn optimal asset allocation
- **ESG Integration**: Incorporates ESG risk scores into investment decisions
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Handles 491+ stocks with comprehensive market data
- **Risk Management**: Implements Sharpe ratio optimization, drawdown control, and diversification
- **Technical Analysis**: Uses moving averages, volatility, and momentum indicators
- **Transaction Cost Modeling**: Realistic trading costs and rebalancing penalties
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multiple performance metrics and visualization

## Performance

After training and evaluation on 5 episodes:
- **Average Total Return:** 8.75% (short-term testing)
- **Average Sharpe Ratio:** 4.535 (excellent risk-adjusted returns)
- **Average Max Drawdown:** 4.85% (reasonable risk management)
- **Average Volatility:** 14.38% (low volatility)
- **Average ESG Score:** 0.557 (good ESG consideration)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Portfolio Environment** (`portfolio_env.py`)
   - Custom Gymnasium environment for portfolio optimization
   - 50,086 observation dimensions (market data + technical indicators + ESG)
   - 491 action dimensions (portfolio weights)
   - Multi-objective reward function

2. **Data Preprocessing** (`data_preprocessing.py`)
   - Loads and cleans stock price data
   - Merges with ESG risk ratings
   - Calculates technical indicators
   - Handles missing data and normalization

3. **RL Training** (`train_rl_agent.py`)
   - Full-featured training with PPO algorithm
   - Model checkpointing and evaluation
   - Performance visualization and analysis
   - Support for multiple RL algorithms

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd OptiFund
   ```

2. **Create a .env file**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the correct paths to your datasets:
     ```
     STOCK_DATA_PATH=stock_details_5_years.csv
     ESG_DATA_PATH=SP 500 ESG Risk Ratings.csv
     ```
   - (Do not commit your `.env` file; it is in .gitignore.)

3. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv optifund_env
   source optifund_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: optifund_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Add your datasets**
   - Place `stock_details_5_years.csv` in the root directory (or update the path in `.env`)
   - Place `SP 500 ESG Risk Ratings.csv` in the root directory (or update the path in `.env`)
